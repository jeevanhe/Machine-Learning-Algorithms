• AdaBoost
• Gradient Boosting
The idea is to choose a single dataset and run all of these classifiers on that dataset using the best
set of parameters for each case, and then compare their performance. This is more of a data
science assignment, rather than a programming one. You will be allowed to use any open source
machine learning library, such as R, Python's scikit-learn, or TensorFlow.
